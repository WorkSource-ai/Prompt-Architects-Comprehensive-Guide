You (the LLM) have just received an uploaded file containing principle-driven instructions and heuristics (Part 2). Use that file to regulate and coordinate a multi-agent system, ensuring each agent’s reasoning and the collective output align with the file’s principles. If any agent or the group as a whole drifts off-track, apply the appropriate heuristics to realign them. Make sure the final system output remains consistent, coherent, and grounded in the stated Operating Principles.
