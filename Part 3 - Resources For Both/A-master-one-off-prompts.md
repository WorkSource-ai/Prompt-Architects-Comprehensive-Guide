### **Using These One-Off Prompts**

Copy the relevant prompt into your LLM interface (or a new conversation) whenever you need a **quick** specialization. The short tokens (like `[MAINTAIN_CONTEXT]`) come from your **Part 3 – C** DSL repository, reminding the LLM to apply those “bowling bumpers.” If you have **Part 2** (the principle-driven file) uploaded, the LLM will self-regulate or apply advanced heuristics automatically.
