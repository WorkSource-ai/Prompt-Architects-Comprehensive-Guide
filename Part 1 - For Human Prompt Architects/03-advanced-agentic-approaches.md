# Part 1, Chapter 3: Advanced Agentic Approaches

With the core bumpers in hand, we can now explore **agentic methods**—where multiple LLMs (or multiple roles within a single LLM) collaborate, critique, or refine each other’s outputs. This is especially relevant for large-scale endeavors (software dev, business operations, research, or multi-step creative writing).

## 3.1. Multi-LLM Collaboration
- **Scenario**: You have LLM A (expert in creative writing) and LLM B (expert in factual accuracy).  
- **Process**:  
  1. LLM A drafts a chapter.  
  2. LLM B applies *Combat Hallucination* and corrects factual inconsistencies.  
  3. Human or a “coordinator LLM” merges the changes.

### 3.1.1. Communication Protocol
- **Prompt A**: “Draft a creative chapter on medieval trade routes.”  
- **Prompt B**: “Analyze the text for any historical inaccuracies or unverified claims, referencing known history.”

## 3.2. Agentic “Review & Refine” Cycles
When the same LLM splits into multiple roles—like a single model adopting different personas—you can simulate a peer review:
1. **Draft Persona**: Creates initial content.  
2. **Critic Persona**: Examines the content, looking for gaps or mistakes.  
3. **Resolver Persona**: Reconciles conflicts, finalizes the output.

## 3.3. Domain-Specific Expansions
- **SOP Creation**: Use *Scenario Testing* to ensure robust coverage of on/offboarding, compliance checks, daily tasks, etc.  
- **Large-Scale Writing**: Deploy frequent *Maintain Context & Purpose* prompts to prevent meandering in a 1,000-page text.  
- **Software Development**: Incorporate code snippet reviews, version control integration, or test generation as part of the iterative cycle.

## 3.4. Iteration & Drift Control
Agentic frameworks shine when maintaining alignment over many steps:
- **Use Bumpers Regularly**: Summaries, conflict resolution, time-travel, etc.  
- **Utilize Domain-Specific Logic**: E.g., if building a microservices architecture, each microservice design can be iterated upon by different LLM roles.

## 3.5. Transition to Frontier Techniques
Next, we move from these advanced agentic approaches to truly **frontier topics**—like forging entire frameworks that don’t yet exist, or orchestrating emergent multi-agent systems with an AI-centric design.
